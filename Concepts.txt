Goal:
    - Manage Nation Industry and Military Develpment up to a Great War

Timeline:
    - First Great War lost
    - Revolution happens
    - [START] Peace time recovering
    - Player development of industry, some potential small conflicts
    - Second Great War begins
    - [GAME OVER] Defeat or Victory

World / Map:
    Super Power near map border(that will be invading us in Second Great War)
    Small nations that declared independence from the player during the Revolution

Other nations aren't actual markets, just simulated based on their population for import and export reasons

Geography:
    Biome:

Military Designs:
    - Player receives requests to approve and start producing new military designs by type
    ie. Central Government asks to develop a new Light Tank
    Player then must contact a Design Institute and develop a tank with characteristics that fit its desire
    The Production Cost, Resources Used are all important to take into consideration for the player
    Additionaly the Central Government may make aditional requests like demanding the Light Tank has a +1 Speed

Gameplay:
    - Start as a large fresh from revolution large nation with Full State Nationalized Economic Planning
    - Deal with budget, careful investments and profit from exporting
    - Invest in industries and infrastructure
    - Other proxy wars that dont matter to the player may occur, but still have to deal with increasing demands
    - Incite and profit from foreign wars
    - Deal with events that may influence production and necessity
    - Educate people to work in industry (Prepare education in region ahead of time)
    - Different scenarios have different starting resources that lead to different progress
    - Invest in resource deposits searching and extraction
    - Focusing on single industries for export may be a problem if price crashes (even more than normal price flunctuation)
    - Identify limited resource outputs and find alternatives in certain industries
    - Industries located where input is gathered have a bonus to production, but connecting industries and resources with infrastructure also gives good bonuses
    - Player may perform industry shifts (like Soviet Union did in WW2) from one region to another, provided that there is good infrastructure to transport it
    - Planing where to place industry is important in case of war
    - Player can not choose to not meet national needs, they are always first met before exporting(based around how import tariffs are very high and importing will always be more expensive)
    - Player must deal with government military expansion demands and be prepared for war

Resource Gathering:
    - Extracted:
        - Mining and Extraction resources in a region have a value of extraction and a non-exploited value
        - Extraction indicates the current extraction
        - Non-exploited indicates the possible extracted value in that region with investment in extraction
        - Regions can also be surveyed for deposits with a likeliness of being found
        - Regions have an hidden maximum extraction value for each resource
        - The likeliness to find the deposit depends on the difference between the current extraction and the hidden maximum extraction.
        (This simulates smaller deposits that can be harder to find)
        - The amount of resources found is randomized after checking the deposit was found
        (Math: Region has 324 tons of coal being [extracted + non-exploited] and 4363 tons of coal as hidden maximum extraction.
        4363 - 324 = 4039       4039 / 4363 = 0.9257 ~ 93%
        Region has 93% chance to find coal deposit
        Survey is made and we get value 23 between 0 and 100
        23 < 93 so survey is successfull
        Calculate how many tons the deposit found has between 0 and 4039)
        - Resources never run dry
        - If [extracted + non-exploited] is 0 and hidden maximum extraction > 0 then the survey chance is 100% so it's better to have regions
        with resources always have the resource identified from the start
        - The starting extraction and non-exploited value of a region is generated from percentages of the hidden maximum extraction
        - Unique names for each resource extraction is a nice touch
    - Farming:
        - Each region has a biome generated on World Generation and a farming suitability % which reduces efficiency

                - Temperature:                  15c
                - Temperature Variation:        5c
                - Precipitation:                1000mm
                - Precipitation Variation:      500mm
        - Farming efficiency is calculated by looking at region mean temperature and precipitation and difference to the ideal of the farming product taking into consideration the variation up to 25%
        ie. Producing Oilseeds in region with 20c and 500mm
        |20c-15c| = 5c
        5c/5c = 1
        1*25% = 25%
        |1000mm-500mm| = 500mm
        500mm/500mm = 1
        1*25% = 25%
        25% + 25% = 50%
        100% - 50% = 50% farming efficiency
        - Farming efficiency can be improved by investing in ways to improve proximity to ideal mean temperature and precipitation
        So the player can choose in a region to invest to reduce mean temperature to farming by 1c
        Each 1c or 100mm change costs more money exponentially(and a lot to begin with)
        Changing farming crop in region removes these investments(some money made from scraping)
        
Budget:
    Initially subsidized but expected to be self sufficient and even return profit(positive trade from exports vs imports)
    Return money to central government, more money returned more they can invest in better military, education, services, research, etc
    Lack of money returned may mean that the military is poorly prepared and we lose the Second Great War
    (The military requirements being met matters very little if the quality of the products is bad and the military is poorly trained)
    (Returning money may lead to military demand to increase)
