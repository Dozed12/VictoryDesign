Goal:
    - Manage Nation Industry and Military Develpment post Great War up to a Second Great War

Timeline:
    - First Great War lost
    - Revolution happens
    - Many territory lost to new states that form
    - [START] Peace time recovering
    - Player development of industry, some potential small conflicts to recover territory
    - Second Great War begins
    - [GAME OVER] Defeat or Victory

World / Map:
    Super Power near map border(that will be invading us in Second Great War)
    Small nations that declared independence from the player during the Revolution

Other nations aren't actual markets, just simulated based on their population for import and export reasons

Gameplay:
    - Play as the Minister of Heavy Industry and Armament
    - Start as a large fresh from revolution nation with Full State Nationalized Economic Planning
    - Deal with budget, careful investments and profit from exporting
    - Invest in industries and infrastructure
    - Other proxy wars that dont matter to the player may occur, but still have to deal with increasing demands
    - Incite and profit from foreign wars
    - Deal with events that may influence production and necessity
    - Educate people to work in industry (Prepare education in region ahead of time)
    - Different scenarios have different starting resources that lead to different progress
    - Invest in resource deposits searching and extraction
    - Focusing on single industries for export may be a problem if price crashes (even more than normal price flunctuation)
    - Identify limited resource outputs and find alternatives in certain industries
    - Industries located where input is gathered have a bonus to production, but connecting industries and resources with infrastructure also gives good bonuses
    - Player may perform industry shifts (like Soviet Union did in WW2) from one region to another, provided that there is good infrastructure to transport it
    - Planing where to place industry is important in case of war
    - Player can not choose to not meet national needs, they are always first met before exporting(based around how import tariffs are very high and importing will always be more expensive)
    - Player must deal with government military expansion demands and be prepared for war

                x2 Iron
                x1 Aluminum
            )

War-time Necessities:
    As tension increases with the enemy nation(before war) the laws change to move more towards Military Industry
    The reduction to necessities is applied as a percentage to the percentage of necessities, not difference
    ie: A has 50% necessities, a law that reduces necessities by 50% will make A have 50% * 50% = 25% necessities
    The change to necessities varies between some laws:
        Full Civilian Economy           100%
        Basic Mobilization              90%
        Full Mobilization               80%
        War Economy                     70%
        Total Economic Mobilization     60%
    This only applies with the large conflict of the Second Great War, not the small conflicts or proxy wars

Industrial Conversion:
    Civilian factories are out of player control but they exist on the map an are visible
    During war time the player can ask to convert some of these factories to other military factories
    Civilian Industries:
        Automobile:
            Convert to Automobile Factory with 50% cost
            Convert to Tank Factory with 70% cost
        Shipyard:
            Convert to Shipyard with 50% cost
        Aircraft
            Convert to Aircraft Factory with 50% cost
        General:
            Convert to everything else with 50% cost
            Convert to Automobile, Tank or Aircraft Factory with 85% cost

Resource Gathering:
    - Extracted:
        - Mining and Extraction resources in a region have a value of extraction and a non-exploited value
        - Extraction indicates the current extraction
        - Non-exploited indicates the possible extracted value in that region with investment in extraction
        - Regions can also be surveyed for deposits with a likeliness of being found
        - Regions have an hidden maximum extraction value for each resource
        - The likeliness to find the deposit depends on the difference between the current extraction and the hidden maximum extraction.
        (This simulates smaller deposits that can be harder to find)
        - The amount of resources found is randomized after checking the deposit was found
        (Math: Region has 324 tons of coal being [extracted + non-exploited] and 4363 tons of coal as hidden maximum extraction.
        4363 - 324 = 4039       4039 / 4363 = 0.9257 ~ 93%
        Region has 93% chance to find coal deposit
        Survey is made and we get value 23 between 0 and 100
        23 < 93 so survey is successfull
        Calculate how many tons the deposit found has between 0 and 4039)
        - Resources never run dry
        - If [extracted + non-exploited] is 0 and hidden maximum extraction > 0 then the survey chance is 100% so it's better to have regions
        with resources always have the resource identified from the start
        - The starting extraction and non-exploited value of a region is generated from percentages of the hidden maximum extraction
        - Unique names for each resource extraction is a nice touch
        - Each resource location has different grading for quality of the ore or extraction which gives a bonus to output:
            High Grade      +20%
            Medium Grade    +10%
            Low Grade       +0%
        - This grading is associated with the noise map that is used to place these resources(higher noise values = higher grade)  

    - Farming:
        - Each region has a biome generated on World Generation
        - Each farming resource has a Biome where it can be produced
        - The player can switch production for another crop that is suitable (with a penalty for x time)
        - Each region also has a farming efficiency value that indicates the global suitability of the region for farming (generate using noise)
        - The global suitability of a region for farming can be improved by investing in Farming Infrastructure
        - Farming efficiency can be improved by Infrastructure, Truck coverage and Tractor average (and indirectly by Farming Infrastructure by increasing suitability)

Military Designs:
    - Player receives requests to approve and start producing new military designs by type
    ie. Central Government asks to develop a new Light Tank
    Player then must contact a Design Institute and develop a tank with characteristics that fit its desire
    The Production Cost, Resources Used and Characteristics are all important to take into consideration for the player
    Additionaly the Central Government may make aditional requests like demanding the Light Tank has a +1 Speed

Military Solutions:
    - There are many types of design types and models
    - Military is centered about filling the need for different kind of necessities
    - The solutions are picked by the government and may change from time to time with some preemptive warning to the player

    - Rifle necessity comes from the total army size the governemnt wants
    - Everything else is expressed as a percentage of the Rifles that exist
    - ^ This forms whats called as the Doctrine and can be changed by the government from time to time
    ie. increase number of tanks per rifleman
    truthfully the ratio of many things starts very low and progressively gets demanded to be higher until a certain value, then it can flunctuate between certain values as the government changes Doctrine
    - Inside Necessities more than one can be picked at a time by the government and it works in a progressive way
    - The government will progressively demand that the ratio inside each necessity moves down more and more(since it's better equipment technology)
    ie. At the start the government may accept that 100% of the rifles are Bolt-action but as time passes it will start to demand moving into Semi-Automatic, maybe 5% in 2 years
    - The government will randomly pick from time to time which necessity to expand on
    - The player can delay the change of Doctrine by 1 year if it's not ready yet or accept it already. Can only delay once.
    - Discrepancy between the government Doctrine and the real existing values leads to worse military performance and may cause to lose the war.
    - Government changes of doctrine are warned in advance(with estimates of cost of resources) so the player can prepare in advance for increasing demand of resources and industrial buildings
    - Doctrine discrepancy only occurs from lack of equipment, excess is stored

Designs & Characteristics:
    - Vehicle engines can pick compatible fuels
