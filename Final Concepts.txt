Timeline:
    - First Great War lost
    - Revolution happens
    - [START] Peace time recovering
    - Player development of military industry, some proxy wars
    - Second Great War begins
    - [GAME OVER] Defeat or Victory

Technological Context:
    - Engines arent powerful enough to have good armor medium tanks so instead there is big distinction of heavy slow armored tanks(infantry tanks) 
    and faster light armor tanks to replace cavalry(cruiser tank) [Interwar British Tank Development]

Doctrine measures the combat ability
Doctrine comes from each design characteristics that influence it
When a new design is picked it takes time for doctrine to receive effect from previous design to new (1/2 of redesign time)
Redesigns are scheduled by the game, no player influence (fixed time with random deviation)

Design Traits:
    Specifc traits for a design that cause permanent or temporary effects
    Types:
        - New Tooling Required (+ Enginnering Cost for x time)

Final Calculation:
    - Calculate how better or how worse than expected(100%) each doctrine part is and sum total
    (could be 2 * diff or more so being very good or very bad at something has bigger impact)
    - Calculate Average of Industrial which results in Army size
    - Finally combine Doctrine calculation with Army size
    - The enemy has an hidden value for these which starts much higher and progressively gets worse
    (Since now Doctrine is middle 100% and around better or worse it should have colors appropriatly) (perhaps coloring on the indicators of 25%, 50%, 75%)
    - EXTRA: Exploitation is only as good as Breakthrough

Create Variant:
    - If previous design was quite good player can choose to create variant instead, losing a bit of random Characteristic and Increasing Industrial costs

Before propositions are shown the player can use X points to make some specific requests (Development Points)
Have Y points to spend, can trade some negatives for positives but limited to X changes

Steps of new Decision:
    - DesignDecision.Text fades to correct Text
    - Proposition appears from under
    - Player makes choices and Issue proposition
    - Proposition moves down
    - Proposals appear from under
    (During proposals the respective design previous Choice and the Combat Report appear by default)
    (The player can hover over other designs to override this though)
    - Player picks Approves choice
    - Proposals move down
