Timeline:
    - First Great War lost
    - Revolution happens
    - [START] Peace time recovering
    - Player development of military industry, some proxy wars
    - Second Great War begins
    - [GAME OVER] Defeat or Victory

Technological Context:
    - Engines arent powerful enough to have good armor medium tanks so instead there is big distinction of heavy slow armored tanks(infantry tanks) 
    and faster light armor tanks to replace cavalry(cruiser tank) [Interwar British Tank Development]

Doctrine measures the combat ability
Doctrine comes from each design characteristics that influence it
When a new design is picked it takes time for doctrine to receive effect from previous design to new (1/2 of redesign time)
Redesigns are scheduled by the game, no player influence (fixed time with random deviation)

Possible Designs to add:
    Siege Artillery
    Cavalry Equipment
    Quartermaster
    Maintenance

Player can early redesign design every x months (can store y redesigns)

Design Traits:
    Specifc traits for a design that cause permanent or temporary effects
    Types:
        - New Tooling Required (+ Enginnering Cost for x time)

Final Calculation:
    - Calculate how better or how worse than expected(100%) each doctrine part is and sum total
    (could be 2 * diff or more so being very good or very bad at something has bigger impact)
    - Calculate Average of Industrial which results in Army size
    - Finally combine Doctrine calculation with Army size
    - The enemy has an hidden value for these which starts much higher and progressively gets worse
    - EXTRA: Exploitation is only as good as Breakthrough and vice versa (Value of both for calculation is Min(Breakthrough, Exploitation))

Create Variant:
    - If previous design was quite good player can choose to create variant instead, losing a bit of random Characteristic and Increasing Industrial costs

Player can create new Institute for Design Types that only have 2 (Cooldown of x time)

Before propositions are shown the player can use X points to make some specific requests (Development Points)
Have Y points to spend, can trade some negatives for positives but limited to X changes

Bulletins:
    Bulletins can be cards with titles that are dragged to cork screen to be read, releasing drops them out of screen
    When no bulletins there is unique graphic for bulletin box

Time:
    Time passes in months that can be paused
    Real time between each month is fixed and displayed in something like an hourglass next to clock

Naming:
    From studied ww2 naming it seems BaseName and Connector is static for Design Type no matter the Design Institute
    These still change over time (ie. "Ta-" as a base and connector for tank design for 3 designs then changes to "KV-")
    The "Specifc" should in turn be changed to either be an increasing Number or Letter (instead of fully randomized every time)
    May also be worth to control BaseNames better, vehicles tend to have small ones like "T" or "KV" or "M" while smallarms tend to have longer like "SVT" or "Ppsh"

Doctrine Importance:
    Doctrines could have varrying importance settled by War Minister, that player can influence slightly
    This Importance would affect the final impact of each Coverage

Steps of new Decision:
    - DesignDecision.Text fades to correct Text
    - Proposition appears from under
    - Player makes choices and Issue proposition
    - Proposition moves down
    - Proposals appear from under
    (During proposals the respective design previous Choice and the Combat Report appear by default)
    (The player can hover over other designs to override this though)
    - Player picks Approves choice
    - Proposals move down
