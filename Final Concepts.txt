Timeline:
    - First Great War lost
    - Revolution happens
    - [START] Peace time recovering
    - Player development of military industry, some proxy wars
    - Second Great War begins
    - [GAME OVER] Defeat or Victory

Technological Context:
    - Engines arent powerful enough to have good armor medium tanks so instead there is big distinction of heavy slow armored tanks(infantry tanks) 
    and faster light armor tanks to replace cavalry(cruiser tank) [Interwar British Tank Development]

Doctrine measures the combat ability
Doctrine comes from each design characteristics that influence it
When a new design is picked it takes time for doctrine to receive effect from previous design to new (1/2 of redesign time)
Redesigns are scheduled by the game, no player influence (fixed time with random deviation)

Industrial:
    Engineering Capacity    -   Engineering Cost
    Resource Capacity       -   Resource Cost
    Replenishment Capacity  -   Reliability   

Army Size:
    Tacken from Industrial values

Doctrine:
    - (AI) Anti-Infantry Ability
    - (AA) Anti-Armor Ability
    - (B) Breakthrough
    - (E) Exploitation
    - (M) Morale

Generic Characteristics:
    - Engineering Cost
    - Resource Cost
    - Reliability
    - Fuel Efficiency (for vehicles only) (maybe add later)

Designs:
    Infantry Rifle:
        - (AI) Accuracy
        - (M) Portability
    Motorcycle Recon(Vehicle):
        - (B) Engine and Suspension
        - 

Design Traits:
    Specifc traits for a design that cause permanent or temporary effects
    Types:
        - New Tooling Required (+ Enginnering Cost for x time)

Adding depth:
    Option 1: Doctrines can be compared with the enemy and final result of all doctrines with army size comparison gives the final result (involves showing enemy too)
    Option 2: Doctrines have an order, Breakthrough is useless if not have Exploitation     

Before propositions are shown the player can use X points to make some specific requests (Development Points)
Have Y points to spend, can trade some negatives for positives but limited to X changes

Steps of new Decision:
    - DesignDecision.Text fades to correct Text
    - Proposition appears from under
    - Player makes choices and Issue proposition
    - Proposition moves down
    - Proposals appear from under
    - Player picks Approves choice
    - Proposals move down
